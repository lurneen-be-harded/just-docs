# The Dirt is in the Soap!

For some reason, when I think of the "deranged paranoid man"
trope, I always imagine him yelling that.

So I figure I better start now, because it looks like
it's only downhill from here.

I don't know who is controlling my network from afar
or why, but the one thing I can say for sure is that
they are.

I have some theories here and there, but it's rare
I catch anything that reveals more of the story.

This repo will be the story of my attempts to uncover
enough of the picture to at least understand why, 
because I doubt I'll be stopping, or even slowing
this rather capable threat actor.
